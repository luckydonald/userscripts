description: "Activates the lplp-pipbuck commit style for the current session. Commits after every completed task, amends the last commit if its message is an `ai:` auto-commit (`ai: updated prompt`, `ai: save decision …`, or `ai: save plan …`), writes messages via ai/git/pending-commit.md, never commits unrelated files. Use when the user opts in to this style at session start, or explicitly asks to enable it."

# lplp Commit Style

Adopt these rules for every commit made this session:

1. **Commit after every completed task.** Never leave work uncommitted.

2. **Check the last 2 commits before committing:**
   - Last message matches one of the `ai:` auto-commit patterns — `ai: updated prompt`, `ai: save decision <slug>`, or `ai: save plan <NNN>_<slug>` → **amend** it.
   - Otherwise → create a new commit.
   - If more than one chained past commits are `ai:` auto-commits (`ai: updated prompt`, `ai: save decision …`, and/or `ai: save plan …`) they probably should be included, too.
     - In that case the `/rebase-ai-prompt-commits` command/skill describes how to rebase & include them.

3. **Always write the message to `ai/git/pending-commit.md` first** like this:
   1. run exactly the whitelisted command `rm ai/git/pending-commit.md || echo 'was gone'`, which makes sure it's not gonna cause "stale unread file" issues.
   2. Write to `ai/git/pending-commit.md` using the preferred Built-in/MCP tool.
   3. Pass it to the commit with `-F ai/git/pending-commit.md`. Never inline the message in the command, to avoid the need for user confirmations.

4. **Message format:**
   ```md
   [where] component-or-topic: ai: Run: <short one-line summary><sentence-separator>

   <multiline body: what changed, why, key decisions>
   ```
   Where examples: `[.idea]`, `[git]` (gitignore etc.), `[github]` (workflows, issue templates, …), `[frontend]`, `[db]`, `[stdb]` (spacetimedb), `[api]`, `[backend]`, `[docker]`, `[coolify]`, `[infra]`, …
   The word or phrase after `[where]` is a component, feature, subsystem, or topic, not a Conventional Commit type. Do not use `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, or `refactor` there unless that word is literally the component or topic being changed.
   Good examples:
   - `[frontend] admin: ai: Run: Implemented user deletion UI.`
   - `[backend] models: ai: Run: Added models for cool feature.`
   - `[backend] cool feature: ai: Run: Added the models.`
   - `[git] ignore rules: ai: Run: Ignored generated cache files.`
   Bad examples:
   - `[frontend] fix: ai: Run: Implement user deletion UI`
   - `[backend] feat: ai: Run: Added cool feature models`
   End every commit summary with a sentence separator: `.`, `:`, `,`, `!`, or `?`.
   Usually use `.` when the summary stands on its own and the body only adds context. Use `:` when the subject needs the body/details that follow to complete the thought.
   Both summary and body may contain pure-markdown for formatting.

5. **Stage only files changed by the current task.** Never stage `ai/git/pending-commit.md` (it is gitignored) or unrelated files.

6. Once this skill is activated, keep commiting after every completed task automatically without asking again.
   If the user responds with a simple `commit` or similar (`commit plz`, `keep commiting`, etc.), this means they want to remind you, to follow the "keep automatically commiting" instruction, which you should already anyway.
