❯ The problem with the failed commit (which is not relevant) is `Co-Authored-By`. There should be a git commit hook - which would prevent this - and should be made sure to work by claude's init script - but never triggers?
Ah, I figured that the "deny" in the claude settings is executed first.
Is there a "on-deny" hook or similar we can hook into, to enhance it with that information that the `Co-Authored-By' and git actions which blindly add all files (`git add . …`, `git add -A …` etc.) are not allowed, instead of just the `Error: Permission to use Bash with command … has been denied.`.
So like our git hook would, if it were to run first/regardless (but it clearly shouldn't. Again, enrich the deny output)

❯ Yes, support both `git commit -m "*Co-Authored-By*"` and `git commit -F` where the file with the commit message is given, which we can then look into as well, to make sure. Support multiple variants of those flags, combined, too. If everything else fails, we still got the commit hook after all.

❯ _The only way to get rich messages is to remove the deny entries and let the `PermissionRequest` hook own the decision. The hook still denies — it just does so with explanation_ so the `PermissionRequest` hook only runs after the `deny` list?

❯ _PermissionRequest hook is effectively "runs before the *interactive* permission prompt, but after the *automatic* deny check."_ This is speculative, right? Can we check that in docs or somewhere?

❯ Create a hook for logging the plan mode decisions. Similar as we hook into `UserPromptSubmit`, I want to document the decisions taken when those multiple choice questions are asked - if possible with the full options to choose from - so it's clear later what the reasoning looked like.

❯ Commit, with prefix `[base] ai: Run: …`.

❯ wait, this commit contained `Co-Authored-By`. Why could we commit?

❯ Create proper test for it in the ai/tests folder.

❯ Also I've attempted your example from earlier, but parsing worked fine-ish, shlex did not error:
```py
>>> import shlex
>>> shlex.split("git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\nfoo\nEOF\n)\"")
['git', 'commit', '-m', "$(cat <<'EOF'\nfoo\nEOF\n)"]
```

❯ Test for
```shell
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
      [base] ai: Run: add PermissionRequest hooks for git add and Co-Authored-By policy

      Replace generic deny-list entries for `git add .` / `git add -A` with a
      `PermissionRequest` hooks that returns rich denial reasons. Also adds
      Co-Authored-By detection for `git commit` messages (via -m, --message=,
      or -F file). The commit-msg hooks remains as final fallback.
      EOF
      )"
```
as well.

❯ Now duplicate that test case with a proper co-Authored, and assert it fails because of shlex detecting it, not shlex erroring/the raw `x in y` workaround from earlier.

❯ commit this change

❯ Check d16d0a4f685c2871cda1b09a4ea56445d23f2d64, it could slip through.

⏺ Committed as d16d0a4. Note that .claude/settings.json wasn't picked up by git (likely gitignored), so only hook.sh was included in the commit — the settings change is still live
   on disk and active.

❯ Alright, commit that fix

❯ What does `Attribution is controlled via the settings.json` in the error message? I think that must be removed.

❯ Commit.

❯ /rebase-ai-prompt-commits

❯ /btw, is there a character suited for folder/file prefixes to imply "this is not very useful folder, don't look inside" like the dot would - and not taking up much space (dot is just a small symbol at the bottom of the "character field"), but which will in a typical folder/file sort appear _after_ all others - i.e. after `Z`?
❯ I've used `ai/°base` now, as that one is still easy enough to type on pretty much every system.

❯ Anyway, back to the `base` repo:
The @scripts/°base/ai/hooks/save-prompt/hook.sh (and @scripts/°base/ai/hooks/save-decision/hook.sh analogous) shall check if the current repo is `base` repo (this current singular prompt execution is) based on folder name and the fact that the remotes are `origin https://luckydonald@github.com/luckydonald/base.git` and `empty   https://luckydonald@github.com/EmptyAAS/empty.git`.
It shall not be a guard, but instead of writing to `ai/query.md` it shall write to `ai/°base/query.md`.
So check that:
1. the folder name is `base`
2. it has only `origin` and `empty` set as remotes
3. the url of origin is luckydonald/base (`.git`, `luckydonald@` optional)

❯ Set up the Git LFS to support `.png` and `.jp(e)g`. Make sure the `README.md` contains the necessary commands for setup.
❯ That readme change for git lfs install is not very thorough. It shall be part of the installation section properly, and definitly also in the quick copy-past command block.
❯ Also add the command for pre-commit, too.

❯ Edit @scripts/°base/ai/hooks/save-prompt/hook.sh to ignore if the message is just a single command of the following list: `/committing-with-lplp-style`, `/rebase-ai-prompt-commits`.

❯ Earlier you managed to commit with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic>` again. Analyze why this managed to get past the `PermissionRequest` check.
The commit which I since rebased and fixed was `base 5338ebc` with the title `ai: skip logging for internal tooling prompt command`, so you can match it in the earlier log.
In any way, also add `<noreply@anthropic>` to the "forbidden" strings, like `Co-Authored-By`.
❯ For those kind of exceptions in there, make sure to raise those errors. Like instead, return a "deny" with the following deny text:
> COMMAND AUDIT ERROR: While trying to calculate if this command is allowed to execute, the script encountered an error. STOP EXECUTION NOW, and show the error to the user, so they can ask for that script to be fixed. Do not attempt to work around it unless specifically asked to by the user. Error message: ...
❯ As it's duplicated, have a func for that. Also, the stacktrace should be shown.

❯ Fix @.claude/hooks/permission-check.py - it allowed the last commit, clearly with `Co-Authored-By`.
Also figure out why the pre-commit hook (@ai/scripts/git/hook/commit/reject_co_authored_by.py) did not trigger or did not prevent it either (`git lfs` interfering?)
❯ First commit via commit style - the previous fixes you already did.

❯ If there is husky, make sure it plays nicely with the rest, and the result is what we want.
Is that yorkie still needed/installed? Should we uninstall it then?
Yeah, in the end I'd want `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`, that makes sense.
In fact there's also the push one, check out the claude `SessionStart` hook which tries to set it as there's no proper husky-like thingo available otherwise.
Ah, maybe we can merge those as `ai/scripts/init/checkout.sh`?
❯ yes, continue with the checkout.sh consolidation
❯ `ai: recorded decision` should be squashed/amended the same way `ai: updated prompt` does

❯ Write me a hook where changing/creating a plan copies it to ài/plans/*.md` and commits it via claude hook py script

Example:

⏺ Updated plan
  ⎿  Wrote 302 lines to /Users/user/.claude/plans/federated-swinging-sphinx.md

From claude session 5693b7f1-e540-44aa-94d7-4a01d9a535ff.

❯ /plan some example plan which will be changed to test this

❯ but, this creates 2 files instead editing the previous one.

❯ No, it shall not amend the commit, but versionate the file. If the title change it shall be renamed - but the number NNN shall stay. You can add meta information about the original filename to track it, too.

› ⚠ skipping async hook in /home/user/git/luckydonald/base/.codex/hooks.json: async hooks are not supported yet
› ⚠ `[features].codex_hooks` is deprecated. Use `[features].hooks` instead.
Enable it with `--enable hooks` or `[features].hooks` in config.toml. See https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic#feature-flags for details.
› Instead, have a python part in the sync script check for that - and fix it after a y/n/exit. Exit shows the path exactly for convenience.

› Fix the `°base` folder selection for automatic `ai: updated prompt` commits broken with either b142385153f6b44d208532036b95a1cb4dd9c9b2 - or they were never working for `codex` before (only `claude`). While at it, make sure those automated commits - including plans and such will prefix commit with `[base] ` like usual for this repository.
› A previous agent produced the plan below to accomplish the user's task. Implement the plan in a fresh context. Treat the plan as the source of user intent, re-read files as needed, and carry the work through implementation and verification.

› the codex plan hook is not writing a correct file to the system:
See commit dbe390bf1766c8227fc3d9c37315a00e7629d8a9 first writing the plan to the query file,
and then immediatly after writing garbage (stdout apparently) to a new plan file in 8f9f93cf2fa3eec36bc3cc69c5f16faac49e584c.
Instead it should write what was in the query file to the plan file.
Make sure to not corrupt the code for claude, the fix only applies to codex.
Also check if this message starting of the plan gets autocommited at least.

› Note that the files mentioned in the commits where fixed manually later by me.

› Migrate claude hook setup to also have a claude param to the script - the commit one already does it like that.

› A previous agent produced the plan below to accomplish the user's task. Implement the plan in a fresh context. Treat the plan as the source of user intent, re-read files as needed, and carry the work through implementation and verification.
› If claude generates new skills or commands, the script shall sync/convert those as well. I.e. it should be able to handle claude adding new ones it it's own format.

› Also, line-based git diffs can be used.

› Okay, working on the hooks still. I want to check that it is working, and fix bugs afterwards. Please enter planning mode, ask me all the fun question formats and then write the plan file multiple times. In the end @ai/°base/plans/ and @ai/°base/query.md shall be updated and reflect each of those actions (questions, messages, plan updates). If not we need to fix it.

› The marker shall be a line of the commit, favoribly the last one preceeded by a single empty line. Above the usual commit message stuff including optional `[base] ` prefix shall happen - create a script to delete a memory with creating a wellformatted delete commit, too.

› git lfs activation causes now on push:
Push failed: Authentication error: Authentication required: You must have push access to verify locks failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/luckydonald/base.git'
› alright, ran the push. Worked. But I don't want to repeat that for every Repo which includes this base. Maybe the fix git script can be extended?

› Fix _Full test discovery still has the pre-existing ai.scripts import issue in the TUI tests_

› Add `uv run --project scripts/°base python -m unittest discover -s scripts/°base/tests -v` to the allowed commands, pretty far down with the other `°base` stuff.

› The $committing-with-lplp-style skill is not good in selecting the word after the `[where]`. Currently it often writes stuff like `[fronend] fix: ai: Run: …`, but it shouldn't be this feat/fix/… commit style (forgot the name), but the component or topic of the change. I.e. `[frontend] admin: Implemented user deletion UI.` or `[backend] models: Added models for cool feature.`. If we're rather on a feature branch or doing a lot of work on the same feature `[backend] cool feature: Added the models.` or similar is possible too. Also notice that every commit shall be ended with a sentence separator, e.g. `.:,!?`. It doesn't need to be a full sentence for that, and the choice is rather based on the rest of the message; Like if you need the information in the detailed rest of the commit message, then it would indicate that with an `:`, otherwise, if it can stand on it's own, and the body is only enhancing it, it would be `.` Usually `.` is the right choice.

› it's missing `ai: Run:` now.
